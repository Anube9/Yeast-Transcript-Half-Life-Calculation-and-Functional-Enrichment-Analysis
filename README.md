# Yeast-Transcript-Half-Life-Calculation-and-Functional-Enrichment-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the yeast transcript half-lives using time series data and identifies genes with significantly high or low half-lives. Then the list of output genes are used to perform a basic functional enrichment analysis to explore potential biological implications.
